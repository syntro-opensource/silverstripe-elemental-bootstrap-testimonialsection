# Customizing
all bootstrap based elements are build to be compatible with the standard
bootstrap css. There are two levels of customization possible.

## Bootstrap CSS
As we build these blocks to be compatible with bootstrap, you can build your
own, custom css and make changes to any bootstrap variable or introduce your
own style. We only used bootstrap native components, so any change you make
will reflect in the block.

## Custom markup
You can customize how the block is rendered by creating any of the following
files in your project:

* `templates/Syntro/BootstrapElemental/Blocks/TestimonialSection.ss`
